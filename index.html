    <h3>undergraduation</h3>
    <p>
        Similarly, my interest in pursuing a career in IT is not a dream originating from a young age. My first encounter with information technology was during my bachelor’s degree at Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology. I was introduced to C programming, Data Structures, and Java programming and their respective labs in the respective semesters, especially a workshop in Python. I have been captivated by all of these workshops and courses in the field of Information Technology and have started researching opportunities in this field. As a part of this coursework and workshop, I was exposed to coding, having to complete coding assignments as part of my undergrad studies. My passion for coding led me to begin coding in competitive coding websites like “Geeks and Geeks" where I was exposed to different kinds of challenging problems thereby laying a solid foundation for programming fundamentals and developing my love for problem-solving.
